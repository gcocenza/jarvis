# J.A.R.V.I.S.

A browser voice assistant with an Iron Man holographic interface. Say
**"Hey Jarvis"**, he wakes, listens, and does real things through your tools —
searches the web, generates images, drives your phone, reads your mail. The face
is a web page (React + Vite + Three.js + custom GLSL). The brain is Claude Code,
run headless as a library.

**The only subscription you need is Claude Code.** No API keys, no OpenAI
account, no cloud bill — the brain runs on your existing Claude Code login, and
the heavy work (the model itself) runs on Anthropic's servers, so even a low-end
laptop only has to draw the interface. **ElevenLabs is an optional add-on** that
gives JARVIS a much better voice and sharper hearing; without it he speaks and
listens through the browser's own speech, and everything still works.

---

## Requirements

**In one line:** a Claude Code subscription, plus two free things every computer
can have — Node.js and Chrome. That's the whole list.

- **Claude Code, installed and logged in** — this is the only account you need.
  Install it with the official method — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`,
  or the platform installer at <https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code> —
  then run `claude` once and complete login. The bridge reuses that login. **No
  API key**, and usage is billed to your existing Claude account.
- **Node.js 20 or newer** — free, one installer from <https://nodejs.org>. This
  is a Node web app, so it is the one unavoidable tool.
- **Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge**, in a **real browser window** — not an
  embedded preview pane. Preview panes (including the one inside editors and
  Claude Code) block microphone access, so the page loads and looks right but
  never hears you. JARVIS also needs WebGL, which these browsers provide.
- **Optional: an ElevenLabs API key** — a good add-on, not a requirement. It
  gives a better voice and sharper transcription; the free tier is plenty for a
  demo. Without it, everything runs on the browser's own speech.

Run `npm run setup` after cloning and it checks all of this for you, in plain
language.

---

## Quick start

First, clone and install, then start it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlesdove977/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
npm install
npm start          # runs the brain and the face together
```

Then open the URL it prints (http://localhost:5173) in **Chrome**, click **INITIALISE** (or **SKIP BOOT UP**), and say **“Hey Jarvis”**.

Prefer two terminals? Run them separately instead:

```bash
npm install
```

Terminal 1 — the brain:

```bash
npm run bridge
```

Terminal 2 — the face:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the app in a **real Chrome or Edge window**:

```bash
open http://localhost:5173
```

Click **INITIALISE**, allow the microphone when asked, and say **"Hey Jarvis"**.

> It has to be a real browser window. Embedded preview panes block the
> microphone, so JARVIS will look perfectly alive and simply never respond.

---

## How it works

JARVIS is two processes. The browser is the face and the voice; the bridge is
the brain and the hands.

```
  ┌─ browser (the face) ───────────────┐        ┌─ bridge (the brain) ─────────────┐
  │  "Hey Jarvis" wake word            │        │  Node · bridge/server.mjs        │
  │  local VAD  →  speech to text      │   ws   │  Claude Agent SDK                │
  │  reactor UI (Three.js + GLSL)      │◄─────► │   = Claude Code, headless        │
  │  text to speech                    │  8787  │  spawns your MCP servers         │
  │  heads-up display                  │        │  permission gate (decideTool)    │
  └────────────────────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything you see and hear happens in the browser. The bridge is a single Node
process (`bridge/server.mjs`) that runs the **Claude Agent SDK**
(`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) — this spawns the real `claude` CLI as a child
process, so **the brain literally is Claude Code, headless.** They talk over a
WebSocket (plus a few HTTP endpoints) on `ws://localhost:8787`.

**Why a bridge at all?** A browser tab cannot spawn the local stdio MCP servers —
`higgsfield`, `elevenlabs`, `android`, `playwright`, `exa`, `serper`, and the
rest. The bridge can. And because it is the Agent SDK, it authenticates off your
existing Claude Code login: no API key, billed to that same Claude account.

**The model.** `claude-opus-5` at effort `medium` by default. Override with the
`JARVIS_MODEL` and `JARVIS_EFFORT` environment variables. On startup the bridge
prints its choice, e.g. `[jarvis] model claude-opus-5 · effort medium`.

### The voice pipeline

The loop is designed so that nothing silently dies and barge-in feels natural.

- **Detection is local.** An energy-based voice-activity detector
  (`src/lib/vad.ts`) decides when you are speaking. It is instant, cannot quietly
  fail, and is what makes **barge-in** work — speak while JARVIS is talking and he
  stops.
- **Transcription has two tiers, chosen automatically at boot.** The browser asks
  the bridge `/health` and picks the best available:
  - **ElevenLabs key present** → ElevenLabs Scribe, via the bridge `/stt` endpoint.
  - **Nothing configured** → the browser's own `SpeechRecognition` (Chrome/Edge),
    guarded by a heartbeat so it recovers when Chrome throttles it.
- **Speaking** uses the **ElevenLabs voice when a key is present**, and the
  browser's `speechSynthesis` otherwise. If a cloud call fails it falls back to
  the browser voice, and if the OS voice itself is broken it latches over to the
  cloud voice.

So it works with no keys and auto-upgrades when a key appears — there is no flag
to set. Capability detection lives in `src/lib/capabilities.ts`, which probes the
bridge's `GET /health` (returning `{ ok, tts, stt }`, both tracking the
ElevenLabs key) once at boot and picks the engines.

## What JARVIS can do

Beyond answering, JARVIS reaches every MCP server in your Claude Code
configuration, and can drive his own interface.

### Your tools

Every server in your `~/.claude.json` is handed to the SDK explicitly. Depending
on what you have installed, that is roughly:

- **Web & search** — `exa`, `serper`, `serpapi`
- **Images & video** — `higgsfield`, `openrouter-image`, `palmier-pro`
- **Voice** — `elevenlabs`
- **Your phone** — `android`
- **The browser** — `playwright`

A few things you can say:

- *"What's happening in AI this week?"*
- *"Generate an image of the Mark VII suit."*
- *"Take a screenshot of my phone."*
- *"Open my GitHub notifications."*

> **Note on account connectors.** Servers you added through your **claude.ai
> account** are not stored on disk, so the bridge cannot see them — it works from
> the servers in `~/.claude.json` (about 14), not the claude.ai ones.

### JARVIS controls the interface

He drives the UI through MCP tools the bridge exposes:

- `ui_theme` — accent, background, per-phase colours
- `ui_reactor` — colour, scale, intensity, spin, and style (`ring` | `sphere` | `wire`), visibility
- `ui_orbit` — put images in orbit around the reactor
- `ui_chrome` — show or hide rails, transcript, badges
- `ui_effect` — `glitch` | `pulse` | `scan` | `shake` | `flash`
- `ui_screen` — clear
- `ui_reset` — back to defaults

So *"make it red, hide the systems list, put that render in orbit"* is a spoken
command.

### The heads-up display

JARVIS authors panels with a `display` tool against a fixed `.hud-*` design
system. The browser sanitises the markup (DOMPurify, a class allowlist and a
strict CSP) before rendering. Rich media works — images, `<video>`, and
YouTube/Vimeo embeds. Remote images and video are fetched **server-side** through
the bridge (`/img` and `/media`, both SSRF-guarded), so hotlink-blocked news
thumbnails still appear and the page never beacons your IP to a host the model
chose.

### Blades are tabs

The big surfaces JARVIS opens (articles, images, galleries, videos, embeds) are
blades, and every blade is also a numbered tab in a strip along the top of the
screen. Blades stay open across turns until you close one; the twelve newest
fit the strip and the oldest falls off.

- Click a background tab to bring its blade forward; click the front tab to
  tuck it away. A tucked blade keeps its page, scroll position and wherever you
  dragged it.
- Double-click a tab name to rename it. The cross closes it for good.
- Say it instead: each turn opens with an `[Open tabs: …]` line the model can
  see (never spoken, never in the transcript), and a `tabs` tool lets him show,
  hide, close or rename one. *"Tuck away tab two"*, *"close the pricing one"*.

## Controls

| Key / phrase | Does |
|---|---|
| **"Hey Jarvis"** | Wake him |
| **Space** | Talk without the wake word |
| Just speak, while he is busy | Queues what you said; it runs after the current answer |
| **"Stop"** (or cancel, wait, hold on) on its own | Cuts him off mid-answer |
| **Escape** / **STOP** button | Stop the current answer and listen; press again when idle to stand down |
| **M** / **MIC ON** button | Mute or unmute the microphone for this session |
| **NOISE STD / STRICT** button | How hard the mic works to keep JARVIS from hearing himself |
| Tab strip | Click to show or tuck a blade, double-click to rename, ✕ to close |
| **V** | Cycle the browser voice |
| **D** | Live diagnostics panel |
| **T** | One-line audio self-test |
| **SYSTEMS** header | Collapse or expand the connected MCP list |

**Mute.** The **MIC ON / MIC OFF** button sits under the signal meter on the
right. Muted, JARVIS hears nothing, not even his name, and the meter reads
MUTED. Muting while he is listening stands him down. The microphone stream stays
open, so unmuting is instant and never asks for permission again. Mute lasts for
the page session.

**The queue.** Talking over him no longer stops him. Whatever you say while he
is thinking, running a tool or speaking goes on an **UP NEXT** list at the
bottom right and runs as its own turn, in order, the moment the current answer
ends. The ✕ on an item drops it. A bare stop word ("stop", "cancel", "hold on")
is the exception and still cuts him off. In *strict* noise mode nothing is
heard while he speaks, so queueing works while he thinks and runs tools only.

**Escape.** Works like the terminal's. While he is busy it abandons the answer
and opens the mic, queue intact, so the next thing you say runs next; the red
**STOP** button under the status line is the same thing. Idle, a second Escape
stands him down and clears the queue.

**Noise guard.** The **NOISE STD / NOISE STRICT** button sits under the mute
button. *Standard* is echo cancellation plus a raised trigger while he speaks,
so a loud interruption still barges in. *Strict* asks the browser for voice
isolation where it offers it, and nothing heard while he is speaking counts as
you, so barge-in by voice is off and **Escape** is how you cut him off. Use
strict when he keeps answering his own sentences through the speakers. The
choice is saved across reloads.

**See your screen.** The **SCREEN** button under the SYSTEMS rail shares a tab,
a window or the whole screen through Chrome's own picker, and **CAMERA** opens
the webcam. Either one opens as a tab you can move and tuck away. While a screen
share is live a screenshot rides along with every message, so "what do you think
of this" needs no command, and "look at this" sees the screen rather than the
webcam. End the share from Chrome's bar and the tab closes itself.

**Settings.** The **SETTINGS** button under the rail opens a small panel:

- **Model** and **Effort** dropdowns list what Claude Code offers on this
  machine. Changing either reconnects the bridge on the new setting and keeps
  the conversation. "Default (from settings)" hands the choice back to your
  Claude Code settings.
- **Noise guard**, the same standard / strict as the button.
- **New conversation** forgets the current thread and starts fresh on the same
  model.

The choice is saved, so a bridge restart comes back on the same model and
resumes the same conversation instead of forgetting it.

**The SYSTEMS rail.** The left rail lists every connected MCP server with a
count. It starts expanded, scrolls once the list is taller than about 40% of
the window, and collapses to a single line when you click its header.

## The boot sequence

Power-up plays a four-beat Iron Man start-up (`src/ui/Boot.tsx`): an
"INITIATING SYSTEM" status bar with a segmented progress bar and boot log; then
concentric reticle rings resolving into "J.A.R.V.I.S"; then a suit schematic;
then the triangular arc reactor lighting up — with a start-up sound under it
(`public/audio/boot-music.mp3`).

Don't want to sit through it? Click **SKIP BOOT UP** under INITIALISE on the
start screen. It skips the animation, the boot cue and the wait, and brings the
live interface straight up in the same theme. A click is still needed either
way, because browsers will not play audio before one.

---

## Configuration

Everything is optional in bridge mode. Frontend settings live in `.env.local`
(copy `.env.example`); bridge settings are environment variables.

### Bridge

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `JARVIS_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8787` | Port for the WebSocket + HTTP endpoints |
| `JARVIS_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5` | Model to run |
| `JARVIS_EFFORT` | `medium` | Reasoning effort |
| `JARVIS_ALLOW_WRITES` | off | `1` allows effectful tools (see below) |
| `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | local dev | Extra WebSocket origins to accept |
| `JARVIS_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN` | off | Accept connections with no `Origin` header |
| `JARVIS_FILE_ROOTS` | — | Roots the `/file` endpoint may serve from |
| `JARVIS_VOICE_ID` | George (en, British) | Fallback ElevenLabs voice id |
| `JARVIS_VOICE_ID_<LANG>` | — | Voice per language, e.g. `JARVIS_VOICE_ID_PT`. The voice carries the accent, so this is what the language button really switches |
| `JARVIS_TTS_LANG` | — | ISO 639-1 default when the page does not name one; flash/turbo v2.5 only |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | — | Optional; enables the ElevenLabs voice, and Scribe as a transcriber |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | — | Optional; transcribes with Groq Whisper, tried first (fastest, multilingual) |
| `JARVIS_GROQ_STT_MODEL` | `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | Groq transcription model |
| `JARVIS_STT_LANG` | auto-detect | ISO-639-1 hint for transcription, e.g. `pt` |
| `JARVIS_WHISPER_MODEL` | `base.en` | Local fallback model; use `small`/`medium` for languages other than English |
| `JARVIS_WHISPER_COMPUTE` | `int8` | Local fallback compute type |
| `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY` | — | Optional; speaks through Fish Audio instead (see below) |
| `JARVIS_FISH_VOICE_ID` | public JARVIS voice | Fish Audio voice (use your own clone's id) |
| `JARVIS_FISH_MODEL` | `s2-pro` | Fish Audio model |
| `JARVIS_FISH_STYLE` | `[calm] [composed]` | Fish Audio delivery tags |
| `JARVIS_WORKSPACE` | — | Run as your full Claude Code in that folder (see below) |
| `JARVIS_CLAUDE_PATH` | `~/.local/bin/claude` | `claude` binary used in workspace mode |

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VITE_BACKEND` | `bridge` (default) or `direct` |
| `VITE_BRIDGE_URL` | Where to reach the bridge |
| `VITE_TTS_ENGINE` | `system` or `kokoro` |
| `VITE_KOKORO_VOICE` | Voice for the Kokoro engine |
| `VITE_USE_ELEVENLABS` | Force the ElevenLabs voice on |
| `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct mode only |

### Adding an ElevenLabs key

You do not have to touch a flag. Either:

- Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` on the bridge before starting it, **or**
- Add the key to your `elevenlabs` MCP server's env in `~/.claude.json` — the
  bridge reads it from there too.

Either way, `/health` starts reporting the capability and the browser picks it up
on the next boot.

### Switching language

The `PT` / `EN` pair on the right rail moves the whole interface in one click:
on-screen text, the lines he speaks while a tool runs, the wake word, the
transcription language and the voice itself. The choice is remembered.

Give each language its own voice — an English voice reading Portuguese is the
accent problem, not the language setting:

```sh
export JARVIS_VOICE_ID_PT=<a Brazilian voice id>
export JARVIS_VOICE_ID_EN=JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb
```

Two things deliberately stay put. The boot log is set dressing, not language.
And nothing tells the model which language to answer in — it follows whoever is
speaking to it, which is what you want and is already steered by the
transcription language.

The local Whisper fallback takes the language per clip now, but the default
`base.en` model is English whatever it is asked for: set
`JARVIS_WHISPER_MODEL=small` for the fallback to follow the button too.

Strings live in `src/lib/i18n.ts`, one table, no i18n library.
`npx tsx scripts/check-i18n.ts` fails on an untranslated or empty entry.

### Hearing you

The bridge transcribes through whichever of these is available, in order, and
falls through to the next one when a request fails:

1. **Groq** (`GROQ_API_KEY`) — Whisper large v3 turbo. Fastest, multilingual, and
   the one to set if you speak to JARVIS in anything but English.
2. **ElevenLabs Scribe** (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`) — note that an ElevenLabs key
   needs the `speech_to_text` permission as well as the one for speech; a key
   scoped only for the voice answers `401` here.
3. **Local faster-whisper** — no key, no network. Warmed at boot, so it is always
   behind the others. `pip install --user faster-whisper` to have it. The default
   `base.en` model is English only: set `JARVIS_WHISPER_MODEL=small` and
   `JARVIS_STT_LANG=pt` (or your language) to make the offline fallback match.

The chain exists because speaking and hearing used to ride the same key, so one
expired or under-scoped credential took out both and `/health` still said it was
listening. `node scripts/check-stt.mjs` boots the bridge with deliberately broken
cloud keys and asserts it still returns words.

### Going back to an earlier conversation

The bridge already resumes the last conversation on its own, so restarting it
does not lose your place. Settings also lists the recent ones by their opening
question — pick one and the bridge reconnects into it. "NEW CONVERSATION" starts
a fresh one, and the previous one stays in the list.

The history lives in `~/.jarvis/sessions-<workspace hash>.json`, alongside the
resume pointer, and keeps the last 20. Delete the file to clear it.

### When he stops hearing you

The SIGNAL rail reads `NO INPUT` when the microphone is open and unmuted but has
delivered nothing but digital silence for twenty seconds — which is what a macOS
sleep/wake does to Chrome's audio stack. It is deliberately silent while you are
muted, because muting produces exactly the same hard zeros and a warning that
fires every time you mute is a warning you learn to ignore.

Reloading the page does not always clear it: the capture is wedged below the
page. Opening any tab on the same origin and calling `getUserMedia` once tends
to shake it loose, and quitting other apps holding the microphone (dictation
tools especially) is the next thing to try, then restarting the browser.

### Adding a Fish Audio voice

Set `FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY` on the bridge and it takes over speech. Set
`JARVIS_FISH_VOICE_ID` to your own cloned voice, or leave it for the public
JARVIS voice. Transcription still uses ElevenLabs if that key is present, and
the browser otherwise. Fish Audio bills the API from **API credit**, separate
from plan credits: a `402 Insufficient API credit` error means topping that up.

---

## Enabling actions

The tool gate starts **read-only**. Search, generation and lookups run freely;
anything effectful — send, tap, delete, install, pay — is denied. Voice is a poor
interface for a confirmation dialog, so the decision is made ahead of time in
`decideTool()` in `bridge/server.mjs`, not at the moment of use. The bridge sets
`settingSources: []`, which makes its own gate the only authority — filesystem
settings and any global `bypassPermissions` cannot override it.

To allow effectful tools (phone, browser driving, sending), run the bridge this
way instead:

```bash
npm run bridge:writes
```

> Read `decideTool()` before you do. *"Hey Jarvis, clean up my downloads folder"*
> means something rather different with writes enabled.

### Workspace mode

By default the bridge runs an isolated Claude Code: no CLAUDE.md, no hooks, no
memory, no project MCP servers. Point it at a project folder and JARVIS becomes
the same Claude Code you use in the terminal there, with that folder's
CLAUDE.md, settings, hooks, skills, `.mcp.json` servers and memory, and the
model and effort from your settings:

```bash
JARVIS_WORKSPACE=/path/to/your/project npm run start:workspace
```

`start:workspace` turns writes on, and in workspace mode that bypasses
permission prompts entirely. Terminal-only output (code blocks, report lines,
insight boxes) is filtered out before it is spoken.

## Troubleshooting

**I can't hear him, or he can't hear me.** Press **D** for the diagnostics panel
— it states plainly whether he is hearing you and whether he is producing sound.
Press **T** for a one-line audio self-test.

**No voice at all.** You must be in **Chrome or Edge**, in a **real browser
window** (not an embedded preview), and you must have **allowed the microphone**.

**Bridge not reachable.** Check that `npm run bridge` is still running in its
terminal, and that nothing else is holding port `8787`.

---

## Security

All of this lives in `bridge/server.mjs`:

- The WebSocket accepts only local dev origins (add more with
  `JARVIS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- `/file`, `/img` and `/media` validate the scheme, confine to allowed roots,
  resolve the real path, and refuse private and loopback addresses (SSRF guard).
- The tool gate (`decideTool`) is default-deny for effectful MCP tools.
- A strict CSP in `index.html`; model-authored panel HTML is sanitised.
